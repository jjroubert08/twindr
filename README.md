#Welcome to Berlin

An app for people that just arrived in Berlin
--

- 10:00: welcome
- 10:30: start hacking!
- 18:00: end of hackday
- 19:00: app pitches 

### Idea

Easy way to find people in a closed context; for example at UIKonf  
and keep track of their more personal details, especially their Twitter handler.

### Tech Challenge
   
Set up a mesh network of iBeacons ( iPhones ).
We can't use the network / wifi mesh because it needs invitations / permissions.

When setting up iBeacons we can create a region with a certain major/minor couple.
You have to enable Bluetooth to use iBeacons.

### Feature Ideas

- authenticate with twitter oath
- filter handles from the iBeacon network your in
- find twitter handles using the public api when someone's is not using our app
